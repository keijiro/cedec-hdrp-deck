This is a repository that contains a presentation deck that was used in my talk
about [Unity HDRP] at [CEDEC] 2018.

The slides were written in markdown and converted into HTML using [Big]. You
can open the deck from `index.html` within a cloned repository, or just
clicking the following GitHub Pages link.
